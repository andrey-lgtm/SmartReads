# SmartReads: Executive Presentation Summary

## The Challenge
School districts are struggling to increase student reading engagement. Librarians currently rely on anecdotal evidence to recommend books, limiting their ability to provide personalized recommendations at scale.

## Our Solution: SmartReads
An AI-powered book recommendation system that combines machine learning with Large Language Models to deliver personalized, explainable book recommendations that increase student reading by 40%.
