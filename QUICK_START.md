## Running the Demo

### Step 1: Resolve Xcode License (Mac Only)
If you're on macOS and see an Xcode license error:
```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license
# Or accept the license through Xcode if installed
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you encounter any issues, try:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment first (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application
```bash
python3 app.py
```

### Step 4: Access the System
Open your browser and navigate to:
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Demo Walkthrough

### 1. Main Interface
When you open http://localhost:8000, you'll see:
- A beautiful, modern interface with gradient design
- Student selector dropdown
- Control buttons for recommendations and analytics

### 2. Getting Recommendations
1. **Select a student** from the dropdown (e.g., "S1A2B3C - Grade 5")
2. Click **"Get Recommendations"**
3. View personalized book recommendations with:
   - Match percentage
   - Explanation of why each book was recommended
   - Strategy used (collaborative, content-based, etc.)
   - Confidence level

### 3. Viewing Analytics
Click **"Show Analytics"** to see:
- Total students and books in the system
- Average books per student
- Catalog coverage percentage
- Most popular genres

### 4. Generating New Data
Click **"Generate New Data"** to create a fresh dataset with:
- 150 unique books
- 75 student profiles
- 1000+ borrowing records

## Key Features to Highlight

### For Technical Partners
1. **Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm**
   - See how different strategies (collaborative, content, LLM) work together
   - Notice the confidence scores and strategy labels

2. **Scalable Architecture**
   - FastAPI backend ready for production
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - RESTful API design

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Natural language explanations for each recommendation
   - Context-aware scoring adjustments
   - Mock mode for demo (easily switchable to real LLM)

### For Non-Technical Partners
1. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive interface requiring no training
   - Clear, actionable recommendations
   - Instant results

2. **Business Value**
   - See analytics showing engagement potential
   - Diversity in recommendations (explore new genres)
   - Data-driven insights

3. **Implementation Readiness**
   - Working system, not just mockups
   - Real algorithms producing real recommendations
   - Ready for pilot testing

## Understanding the Recommendations

### Recommendation Scores
- **90-100%**: Perfect match based on multiple signals
- **70-89%**: Strong match with good confidence
- **50-69%**: Moderate match, worth exploring
- **Below 50%**: Exploratory/diversity recommendations

### Recommendation Strategies
- **Collaborative**: Based on similar students' preferences
- **Content**: Based on book characteristics and descriptions
- **Diversity**: Introducing new genres/topics
- **Popularity**: Fallback for new users

### Confidence Levels
- **High (80%+)**: Strong data support
- **Medium (50-79%)**: Good data support
- **Low (<50%)**: Limited data, exploratory

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill the process using port 8000
lsof -i :8000  # Find the PID
kill -9 <PID>  # Kill the process
```

### Module Import Errors
```bash
# Ensure you're using Python 3.11+
python3 --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```
