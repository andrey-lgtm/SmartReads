# SmartReads: AI-Powered Book Recommendation System for School Districts

## Executive Summary

SmartReads is an intelligent book recommendation system designed to increase student reading engagement by leveraging AI and machine learning to provide personalized, data-driven book recommendations. The system combines historical borrowing data with modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand reading patterns, preferences, and provide contextual recommendations that resonate with students.

### Key Value Propositions
- **Increase Reading Engagement**: 40% expected increase in books borrowed per student
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Transform anecdotal knowledge into systematic recommendations
- **Scalable Solution**: Serves entire district with minimal per-school overhead
- **Teacher & Librarian Empowerment**: Augments human expertise, doesn't replace it

## Problem Statement

Current challenges in the school district:
- Librarians rely on anecdotal evidence for book recommendations
- No systematic way to track what types of books engage different student groups
- Limited ability to discover new books that match student interests
- Difficulty in scaling personalized recommendations across large student populations

## Solution Overview

SmartReads employs a hybrid recommendation approach combining:
1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Leveraging borrowing patterns across students
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Using book metadata and descriptions
3. **LLM-Enhanced Understanding**: Deep semantic understanding of book content and student preferences
4. **Explainable Recommendations**: Clear reasoning for each recommendation
